## Source and contributions
Some of these snippets come from a [GitHub Gist as part of my conference speech & blog series]((https://gist.github.com/oliveratgithub/81d0bfea53f79047ccce86e3b22da52b)) some time ago. Other parts come from my previous Coda 2 installation so as an active project I work on.
